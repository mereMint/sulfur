# NOTE: OpenAI Python SDK is not required for runtime. We call OpenAI via HTTP in code.
# Installing `openai` pulls in `jiter` which fails to build on Termux/Android.
# If you need the SDK for local testing, install it manually: `pip install openai`.
# NOTE: PyNaCl is required for Discord voice support.
# On Termux/Android, you need to install libsodium and clang first: pkg install libsodium clang
# Also set SODIUM_INSTALL=system before pip install to use the system libsodium library
# The termux_quickstart.sh script handles this automatically.
# NOTE: SpeechRecognition provides local STT support (Google Speech Recognition API)
# For better quality, use Whisper API with your OpenAI key (already implemented)
