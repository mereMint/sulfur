# PyNaCl  # OPTIONAL: Required for Discord voice support. Commented out due to build issues on Termux/Android.
# NOTE: OpenAI Python SDK is not required for runtime. We call OpenAI via HTTP in code.
# Installing `openai` pulls in `jiter` which fails to build on Termux/Android.
# If you need the SDK for local testing, install it manually: `pip install openai`.
# NOTE: PyNaCl is required for Discord voice support. It's installed automatically with discord.py[voice],
# but we list it explicitly to ensure it's present on platforms where it builds successfully.
# On Termux/Android (aarch64), PyNaCl may fail to build due to native compilation issues.
# The bot will work without it - voice features will be automatically disabled.
# To install PyNaCl on supported platforms: `pip install PyNaCl`
