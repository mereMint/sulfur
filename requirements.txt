# NOTE: OpenAI Python SDK is not required for runtime. We call OpenAI via HTTP in code.
# Installing `openai` pulls in `jiter` which fails to build on Termux/Android.
# If you need the SDK for local testing, install it manually: `pip install openai`.

# NOTE (Termux/Android users): The discord.py[voice] extra requires PyNaCl, which needs
# libsodium to build. On Termux, install system dependencies first:
#   pkg install libsodium clang
# Then set environment variable before pip install:
#   export SODIUM_INSTALL=system
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or use the provided scripts (quick_setup.sh, termux_quickstart.sh) which handle this.
